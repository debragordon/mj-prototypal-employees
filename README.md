# NSS Exercise | Prototypal Inheritance / Employees

## Description
We were tasked to harness the power of prototypal inheritance and build an employee roster for our company.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo to your local computer
2. In your terminal be sure you are in this downloaded directory
3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser to view the files; it will be preferable to view in Google Chrome
5. Once online, open the dev. tools to view the console log where you will see the full employee listing
